      <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 sm:mb-3 text-gray-900 mt-6 sm:mt-10">Slots</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
        In blackjack, you play against the dealer, and the goal is to beat them with a higher score without going over 21. Blackjack uses luck and skill and is known for its low house edge. It is popular as an RNG game or as a live dealer option.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
        Baccarat is a good entry-level casino game but also a connoisseur’s choice. You can play RNG and live dealer variants, where you bet Banker, Player, or Tie on each hand. The winner holds the cards closest to a value of nine without going over.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 sm:mb-3 text-gray-900">Roulette</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
        Famous for Texas Hold’em, many versions of stud and draw poker exist. We recommend stock video poker games and live dealer poker options for casinos. It is worth noting that there are standalone poker sites that offer tournament-style gameplay.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
        Use the quick and straightforward tips below to enhance your experience when using an online crypto casino:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-5 sm:ml-6 mb-3 sm:mb-4 text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg">
        <li>Select a reputable casino: Any casino you use online should have a license and use security features such as SSL encryption.</li>
        <li>Test the casino: One of the good things about crypto casinos is the ability to sign up without sharing personal details. You can explore a casino and play free game demos to test the experience before making a real deposit.</li>
        <li>Use bonuses: Bonuses and promotions allow you to extend your gameplay or boost your bankroll. Crypto casino promos are always lucrative, but remember to pay attention to T&Cs first.</li>
        <li>Crypto Volatility: Cryptocurrencies can fluctuate in value, sometimes quickly. This volatility means winnings you make may be worth less when you cash them out.</li>
        <li>Try Multiple Casinos: We absolutely recommend that you choose a few different casinos and rotate them to take advantage of promotions and different game libraries.</li>
        <li>Set a budget and stick to it: Define how much crypto you’re willing to spend before starting, and avoid chasing losses by depositing more than you planned.</li>
        <li>Use a secure crypto wallet: Always store your funds in a trusted wallet (like MetaMask or hardware wallets) rather than leaving them in casino accounts.</li>
        <li>Check payout speed and fees: Some casinos process withdrawals instantly, while others take longer or charge higher fees. Review these policies before depositing.</li>
        <li>Diversify your bets: Don’t put your entire bankroll into one game. Spread it across slots, table games, and even sports betting to balance risk.</li>
        <li>Stay updated on promotions: Many crypto casinos offer limited-time rewards or seasonal bonuses—subscribing to newsletters or Telegram channels helps you stay in the loop.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-2 sm:mb-3 text-gray-900 leading-tight">Responsible Gambling & Staying Safe</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
        The golden rule of using any online crypto casino is to always stick to responsible gambling. Set your budget or disposable income and then don’t chase losses. You should be enjoying yourself playing casino games. The moment you’re not, or you feel you are gambling to solve financial issues, you should take some time out.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-2 sm:mb-3 text-gray-900 leading-tight">The Future of Crypto Gambling: Trends to Watch</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
        The crypto gambling industry is one of the fastest evolving sectors, with key trends set to shape future changes. We expect provably fair gaming through the blockchain to become more widespread. Also, more casinos may explore technologies such as the metaverse, which could provide immersive casino lobbies and integrated crypto payments through NFT transactions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 sm:mb-4">
        Regulatory changes will play a pivotal role in the growth of crypto gambling sites. More countries are likely to embrace crypto casinos, but some may yet impose stricter restrictions. Even so, innovation will continue to shape the industry and lead crypto casinos into a significant expansion in the coming years.
